# Updated Dashboard   

**Created a Weather Dashboard using HTML,CSS and JS. Used Openweather API for fetching current weather,aqi of the city and five days forecast**  

**Frameworks and other tools**  
`chart.js` : for plotting graphs of temperature, humidity and windspeed.  
`OpenWeather API` : From this website, 3 APIs are fetched which are for Current Data, AQI and Weather Forecast.  

***WORKING***  
The user will be asked to enter a city name on the top right corner of the page.  
Then if the city name is not valid `data.cod != 200` then a warning will be raised about the valid city name.  
Else, the required data are displayed on the page with two grpahs `Temperature throughout the day` and `Humidity and wind speed` using Chart.js.
